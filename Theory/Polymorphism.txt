Polymorphism
=====================
Executing methods in more than one forms or taking more than one forms or computing one task in different ways.

poly-------many
morphism------forms

Types of Polymorphism:
===============================
Method overloading (compile time polymorphism / ststic binding / static polymorphism)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
with the same method you will create multiple methods and the methods differ based on the argument and the argument are different datatype,datatype count and datatype order

same class
same method name
diff parameter/argument

the argument depends on dataType
the argument depends on dataType number or count
the argument depends on dataType order

Method overriding(runTime polymorphism / dynamic binding/ Dynamic polymorphism)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever you are not satisfied with the business logic of your parent class method, you will create the same method with same argument in the child class and when you create the object reference and the call method , the child class method will get the preference. so you are overiding the parent class method with the child class method.

same method name
same argument / parameter
diff class
